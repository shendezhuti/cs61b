cs61b听课笔记&问题

1.course overview & using objetcts

Goal of cs61b
1)learning efficient data structure&algorithms
2)designing&writing large programs
3)understanding&designing data abstraction &interfaces
4)learning java

objected-oriented programming
object: a repository of data
class: type of object
method: procedure of function that operates on an object
Inheritence: A class may inherit properties from a more general class
	shoppingList inherit from list

polymorhism: one method works on several classes, even if the classes need different implementions 
	e.g. "additem" method on every kind of List, though adding item to a shoppinglist is different from a shopping cart

ojbect-oriented: each object knows its own class & method 

Java 
variable: you must declare them and their type
		int x;
		x=1;

does 2 things:
(1)allocates memory to store on integer, type "int".
(2)names variable "x".			

variables also used to reference objects

2 ways to get classes:
(1)use one defined by somebody else. Java has tons 
(2)define your own.					

String myString;	<-varibale (not object)
		mySring=new String();
2 steps:
		new String() is a constructor
		assignment "=" causes myString to reference the object

java programs must be compiled before you can run them

Java  Java program(.java) -javac-> .class files -java-> answer  
													JVM do the job

Object & Constructors
String s;
String s2=s;
s="Yow!"
s2="Yow!" 

s2=new String(s) 有五步操作
(1)look where s points
(2)follows reference to string object
(3)reads string 
(4)consturct new string w/copy of character
(5)make s2 reference new String

Methods
s2=s.toUppercase();

I/O class & object
Object in System class for interacting with a user
System.out is a Printstream object that output to the screen
System.in is an Inputstream object that reads from the keyboard 这里其实是指reference

To use Java libraries, other than java.lang, we "import" them 
java.io includes InputStreamReaders, BufferedReader, etc .

2.defining classes

unix/vim help session  真滴羡慕ucb的学生
Fields: variable stored in objects  
		aka instance variavle 

Defalut constructor takes no parameter, does no initializing
只写一个constructor defalut constructor gone

The "this" keywod 
amanda.introduce() implicitly pass an object (amanda) as a parameter called "this"
local variable 相比于 field varibale more priority(更具有优先级)

IMPORTANT: You cannot change the value of "this"
this.amanda; -> compiler error

the "static" keyword
static field: a single variable shared by a whole class of objects 
also called class variable

System.in & System.out are static fields

static method: does not implicitly pass an object as a parameter

IMPORTANT: In a tatic method,there is no "this"!!
referencing "this" ->compile-time-error
